## 🔒 Security Features

### Available Security Tools

EasyPanel MCP provides the following security-related capabilities:

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **API Key Authentication** | ✅ Available | Secure Bearer token authentication |
| **Email/Password Auth** | ✅ Available | Alternative authentication method |
| **Session Management** | ✅ Available | Automatic session token handling |
| **SSL/TLS Verification** | ✅ Available | Configurable SSL verification |
| **Internal Networks** | ⚠️ Via Service Config | Isolated networks via service configuration |
| **Basic Auth** | ✅ Available | HTTP basic auth for services |
| **Domain Management** | ✅ Available | Custom domain configuration |
| **Port Exposure Control** | ✅ Available | Manage exposed ports |

### Security Best Practices

#### 1. Use API Keys (Recommended)

```bash
# Generate API key in EasyPanel Dashboard
# Settings → API Keys → Create New Key

# Use in .env
EASYPANEL_API_KEY=ep_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Advantages:**
- More secure than password
- Can be rotated easily
- Can be revoked without changing password
- No plaintext password storage

#### 2. Isolated Networks (Internal Services)

EasyPanel manages networks automatically. To create isolated services:

```json
// Ask your AI agent:
"Create a PostgreSQL service in an isolated network"

// The AI will configure:
{
  "name": "postgres-db",
  "projectId": "your-project",
  "sourceImage": "postgres:15",
  "internal": true  // ← Isolated from internet
}
```

**What happens:**
- EasyPanel creates an internal Docker network
- Service is only accessible by other services in the same network
- No public exposure

#### 3. Environment Variables Security

```bash
# Ask AI to set sensitive env vars:
"Set DATABASE_URL environment variable for my-api service"

// The AI will use:
services.app.updateEnv with encrypted values
```

#### 4. Port Management

Control which ports are exposed:

```json
// Ask your AI:
"Expose port 8080 for my-api service but keep database internal"

// Configuration:
{
  "ports": [
    {"public": 80, "private": 8080, "protocol": "http"}
  ]
}
```

## 🌐 Isolated Networks

### How EasyPanel Handles Networks

EasyPanel **automatically manages Docker networks**. You don't need to create networks manually.

**Network Types:**

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Public Network** | Services accessible from internet | Web apps, APIs |
| **Internal Network** | Services only accessible internally | Databases, caches |
| **Project Network** | Services within same project can communicate | Microservices |

### Creating Isolated Services

#### Method 1: Ask Your AI Agent

```
User: "Create a Redis database that's only accessible internally"

AI: 📦 Creating Redis service...
    🔗 Configuring internal network...
    ✅ Service 'redis-cache' created (internal only)
    🔒 Not exposed to internet
```

#### Method 2: Manual Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "redis-internal",
  "projectId": "proj_xxx",
  "sourceImage": "redis:7",
  "env": {
    "REDIS_PASSWORD": "secure_password"
  },
  "ports": [],  // ← No public ports = internal only
  "internal": true
}
```

### Service-to-Service Communication

Services in the same project can communicate automatically:

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│  API App    │ ──────► │  PostgreSQL  │
│  (Public)   │  Internal│  (Private)   │
└─────────────┘  Network└──────────────┘
```

**Example:**
```bash
# API can connect to database via:
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@postgres-db:5432/mydb

# But database is NOT accessible from internet
```

| `get_service_logs` | Get service logs | Debug issues |
| `inspect_service` | Get service details | View configuration |
| `get_system_stats` | System monitoring | Check resources |
| `get_service_stats` | Service metrics | Performance data |

### Debugging with AI

#### Example 1: Service Not Starting

```
User: "My API service won't start, what's wrong?"

AI: 🔍 Inspecting service...
    📊 Checking logs...
    
    ❌ Error found:
    - Port 3000 already in use
    - Another service is using this port
    
    💡 Solution:
    Would you like me to:
    1. Change the port to 3001?
    2. Stop the conflicting service?
```

#### Example 2: Database Connection Failed

```
User: "My app can't connect to the database"

AI: 🔍 Checking configuration...
    📊 Testing connection...
    
    ❌ Error: Connection refused
    🔍 Root cause: DATABASE_URL is incorrect
    
    Current: postgres://localhost:5432/db
    Should be: postgres://postgres-db:5432/db
    
    💡 Fix: Update DATABASE_URL environment variable?
```

#### Example 3: High Memory Usage

```
User: "Is my service running okay?"

AI: 📊 Checking system stats...
    
    ⚠️ Warning detected:
    - Memory usage: 95% (1.9GB / 2GB)
    - CPU usage: 45%
    
    💡 Recommendations:
    1. Increase memory limit to 4GB
    2. Check for memory leaks
    3. Enable horizontal scaling
    
    Would you like me to increase resources?
```

### Log Analysis

```
User: "Show me the last 100 lines of logs for my-api"

AI: 📜 Retrieving logs...

    2026-03-14 10:30:15 INFO  Starting API server...
    2026-03-14 10:30:16 INFO  Connected to database

    2026-03-14 10:31:00 ERROR Request timeout for /api/users
    2026-03-14 10:31:01 WARN  High latency detected
    
    🔍 Analysis:
    - 2 errors in last hour
    - Timeout issues on /api/users endpoint
    - Possible database performance issue
```

## 📈 Auto-Scaling Features

### Scaling Options in EasyPanel

| Type | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Vertical Scaling** | Increase CPU/Memory | ✅ Available |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Multiple replicas | ⚠️ Via Service Config |
| **Auto-Scaling** | Scale based on metrics | ⚠️ Manual trigger |

### Vertical Scaling (Resources)

```
User: "My service needs more resources, scale it up"

AI: 📊 Current resources:
    - CPU: 1 core
    - Memory: 2GB
    
    📈 Scaling up to:
    - CPU: 2 cores
    - Memory: 4GB
    
    ✅ Resources updated!
    🔄 Service restarting with new limits...
```

### Horizontal Scaling (Replicas)

```
User: "I need 3 replicas of my-api service"

AI: 📊 Current replicas: 1
    📈 Scaling to: 3 replicas
    
    ✅ Replica 1: Running
    ✅ Replica 2: Running
    ✅ Replica 3: Running
    
    🔄 Load balancer configured
```

### Monitoring-Based Scaling

```
User: "Check if my service needs scaling"

AI: 📊 Analyzing metrics...
    
    Current usage (last 24h):
    - CPU: 85% average, 95% peak
    - Memory: 78% average, 92% peak
    - Requests: 1000/min average
    
    ⚠️ Recommendation: Scale up
    
    Proposed configuration:
    - CPU: 2 → 4 cores
    - Memory: 4GB → 8GB
    
    Proceed with scaling?
```

### Manual Auto-Scaling Script

You can create automation scripts:

```python
# Example: Check and scale based on CPU usage
async def auto_scale():
    stats = await client.get_system_stats()
    cpu_usage = stats['cpuInfo']['usedPercentage']
    
    if cpu_usage > 80:
        print("⚠️ High CPU usage, scaling up...")
        await client.update_service(service_id, {
            "cpu": current_cpu * 2
        })
```
